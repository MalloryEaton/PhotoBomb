1. This program allows a user to select a directory from their computer, which shows them a list of jpeg images in that directory. They can select
	any of the sub-directories in that directory. The user can double-click on an image to open an editor that will allow them to edit and save
	any changes to that image. The available edits include changing the brightness, inverting the colors, or changing the color of the image.
	
2. Bugs: flashing when loading images, .....

3. Extra credit: Number 1, the Splitter control; Number 3, showing the images as they are loaded

4. Mallory: She worked on the Edit Photo form and the about box; all of the functionality for editing the photos, saving them, the transformation progrses box, etc.
	Ethan: Ethan worked on the Main form; he did the reading in of the files/images, populating the list and tree views, double-clicking on an image to open the editor, etc.
