1. This program allows a user to select a directory from their computer, which shows them a list of jpeg images in that directory which may be 
	displayed in a large, small, or detailed view. They can select any of the sub-directories in that directory or select a different root 
	directory. The user can double-click on an image to open an editor that will allow them to edit and save any changes to that image. 
	The available edits include changing the brightness, inverting the colors, or changing the color of the image. The user may select an 
	image and use the "Locate on Disk" option to show where the file is located on the computer. The user may also use the "About"
	option to display information about the program and developers.
	
2. Bugs: None that we know of

3. Extra credit: Number 1 the splitter control, and Number 3 showing the images as they are loaded
